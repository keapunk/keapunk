what can you do with a git repository?  well:

	git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
or...
	git clone git@github.com:keapunk/keapunk.git


cool.  so how do you make one?

if i recall, i installed git ...

	apt-get install git-core

then ...

	git config --global user.name "Kea Punk"
	git config --global user.email kea@kea.gen.nz

and added a public key.

make sure key creation and git operations are all under same login account!

also, be careful to copy the exact bytes of ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub into the meagre text area provided on your 
github account page.


now this should work:

	mkdir keapunk
	cd keapunk
	git init
	touch README
	git add README
	git commit -m 'first commit'
	git remote add origin git@github.com:keapunk/keapunk.git
	git push origin master

if push fails, try

	ssh -v git@github.com


if you're root (or some other irrelevant user) you'll get some incomprehensible barf along the 
lines of...

	OpenSSH_4.7p1 Debian-8ubuntu1.2, OpenSSL 0.9.8g 19 Oct 2007
	debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
	.
	.
	.
	debug1: identity file /root/.ssh/identity type -1
	debug1: identity file /root/.ssh/id_rsa type -1
	debug1: identity file /root/.ssh/id_dsa type -1
	.
	.
	.

you're looking for:

	.
	.
	debug1: identity file ~/.ssh/id_rsa type -1
	.
	.

but one reason you might have decided to become root is if the ssh tools you're using responded with the 
error:

	.
	.
	PRNG is not seeded

..and you realised that you don't have permission to read /dev/random

at this point, DO NOT SUCCUMB TO THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE AND BECOME ROOT!

simply do:

	sudo chmod a+rw /dev/random

and proceed as the user you yearn to be.

now, if it's the first time you've ssh'd to git as whatever user you are, you'll get:

	.
	.
	The authenticity of host 'github.com (207.97.227.239)' can't be established.
	RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	.
	.

this is not an error.  most people just say yes (take me now):

	.
	.
	Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,207.97.227.239' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
	.
	.

but then, if (as explained above) you're attempting to connect as a different user to the one that created 
your public key on git, you'll see something like...

	.
	.
	debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
	debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
	debug1: Trying private key: /root/.ssh/identity
	debug1: Trying private key: /root/.ssh/id_rsa
	debug1: Trying private key: /root/.ssh/id_dsa
	debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
	Permission denied (publickey).
	.
	.

boo hoo.  the lesson is, be consistent.  know yourself.  if you get all these ducks in a row, you can find nirvana.  

this is how ssh works...  a merchant sends a box and an open padlock across the sea to his trading partner, keeping the key in his desk drawer.  his trading partner puts his own key and lock in the box, locks it with the merchant's padlock and sends it back to it's owner.  viola! a secure channel is born!

	.
	.
	debug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).
	debug1: channel 0: new [client-session]
	debug1: Entering interactive session.
	debug1: Sending environment.
	ERROR: Hi keapunk! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access
        debug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype exit-status reply 0
	debug1: channel 0: free: client-session, nchannels 1
	Connection to github.com closed.

	debug1: Bytes per second: stdin 0.0, stdout 0.0, stderr 60.7

	.
	.


YAY! now you have to commit them to a brand new commit, not an old one you've already pushed and amended 
on yr working tree.  then ...

	git push origin master

and your masterpiece is safe!  to see your changes on your github repository, you have to do a git pull [http://github.com/keapunk/keapunk/pull_request/] from git hub, adding as recipients your own account name and/or any other 3v1lhxrs whose public keys have infected your ring.

the way i work with git is, for each task, checkout a branch...

	git pull
	git checkout -b taskname master

then, work work work ...

	git add file*.[ch]*
	git commit -m 'taskname is live!'

coffee. work work work ...

	git add file*.[ch]*
	git commit --amend

tested! works! finished!

	git checkout master
	git pull
	git checkout taskname
	git rebase master

might need to fix conflicts, in which case repeat the above seqence (add, pull, rebase)

now ...

	git log

	git show 9c77a02b606aa84b9d862a583ba5d7bcc857e313

are these the changes you want preserved for posterity?

	git checkout master
	git cherry-pick 9c77a02b606aa84b9d862a583ba5d7bcc857e313
	git push origin master

.................. thats just one way of doing it, but it works for me..
